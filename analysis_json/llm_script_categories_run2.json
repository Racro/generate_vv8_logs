This involves manipulating the DOM by ensuring that certain actions related to advanced ads are ready to be executed. Additionally, it provides utility functionality by managing the queue and ensuring the 'advanced_ads_ready' function is called for each item in the queue.", "The script defines a template function that interacts with the DOM by checking for the presence of an element with a specific ID and retrieving its HTML content. It also includes AJAX operations for sending and receiving data asynchronously using jQuery's Deferred and ajax methods. Additionally, it provides utility functions for handling AJAX settings and responses.", "The script dynamically creates a script element and inserts it into the DOM to load an external script asynchronously from 'https://www.clarity.ms/tag/'. It also sets up a function to queue arguments for the 'clarity' object.", "The script performs several tasks: \n1. DOM Manipulation: It interacts with the DOM to check element properties, modify attributes, and query elements (e.g., `document.querySelectorAll`, `document.querySelector`, `document.addEventListener`). \n2. Asynchronous & Network Operations: It uses `fetch` to make network requests and handle responses asynchronously with `async/await`. \n3. Utility Functions: It includes logging and debugging functionalities (e.g., `console.log`), performance monitoring (e.g., `Date` for timing), and state management (e.g., checking if the page is cached).", "The script performs several actions: it manipulates the DOM by creating and appending a script element to the document body or current script's parent element. It also handles asynchronous network operations by setting the source of the script element to a URL that includes parameters and cookies. Additionally, it manages cookies by reading and setting them, which falls under utility functions.", "The script initializes and configures a consent management platform (CMP). It involves DOM manipulation by creating and appending script elements to the document. It also includes asynchronous operations by setting timeouts and loading scripts dynamically. Additionally, it contains utility functions for logging and debugging.", "The script listens for the DOMContentLoaded event to initialize YouTube video players by creating and appending div elements with specific attributes and event listeners for click and key events. It generates YouTube thumbnails and handles user interactions such as clicks and key presses to load YouTube iframes."]}
